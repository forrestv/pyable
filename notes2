FOCUS

each code fragment KNOWS the variables it uses' types
operations that return variable types ... eg 

handling integers
we have int0, int1, int2, int3, int4, int5, int6, int7, ...
each operation _must_ return the smallest one to fit it ... hmmm maybe cap lower at 4, lol

for bigger ones, have immutable by reference
