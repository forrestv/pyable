each code fragment KNOWS the variables it uses' types
operations that return variable types ... eg 

handling integers
we have int0, int1, int2, int3, int4, int5, int6, int7, ...
each operation _must_ return the smallest one to fit it ... hmmm maybe cap lower at 8 and multiples of 8

for bigger ones, have immutable by reference


have each function have multiple return points depending on the type

---

use negative index locals

and adjust stack when calling :D
