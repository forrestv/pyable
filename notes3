the age-old question:

how do you store an object (that could be of any type) in a binary container? (in a sane, small, fast way :)

right now we're going with 'the compiler knows the type at compile-time'

oh right the invalidation

----

object typing

store type somehow in object, uplift whenever it could have changed

---

tuple

pointer to:
    type number
    object data

maybe optimize one/zero-tuple (or longer?)

object

pointer to:
    object class <shouldn't this be moved to compiler ... yeah!>
    attribute type
    pointer to:
        attributes

maybe optimize empty object?

--

variable or fixed object size?

variable pros
- saves space
- saves time

fixed pros
- simpler
- makes O(1) indexing possible and you can store more complex object type inline

--

we need an actual unlift operator .. would be nice at least :p

---

tuple/list needs to be an abstract container with the type ids ... this is not going to be very optimal otherwise

tuple

pointer to:
    length
    length * pointer to:
        type.id
        type data

-> massive! D:

issues
we need O(1) indexing
the tuple should contain the type data since we'd have to unlift anyway for non-constant getitem

pointer to:
    length:
    length * this record:
        type.id
        type.data (padded to 16 bytes)

OR

pointer to:
    length:
    length * offset (in smallest possible type)

---

tuple2

pointer to:
    length
    length * offset
    stack data
